As a beginner to git the first thing that a beginner needs 
to know is how to create a repository, also known as a repo.
A repo is used to organize folders, files, images, videos, 
spreadsheets, or data sets needed for a single project.

To create my own repository, I click in the + button next 
to my avatar and then select add a new repository, initialize
it with a README, provide a description of the project, and then create it.

After branching and commits to changes, which we already did in class, there are pull requests.
Pull Requests are a major of collaboration on Github. It is showing someone
the contribution you made and asking them to review and pull it in and merge 
with their branch. 

To open a pull request click on the pull request tab and then the new request button.
Compare you changes to the master and make sure that it is what you want to submit. 
If the changes are what you want to submit then click on the Create Pull Button. 
It will then prompt you to give it a title and then write a brief description about it.

After a pull request is a success, a window will pop up and if it says that your branch 
has no conflicts with the base branch then you able to proceed to the next step which is 
merging your request. To merge a request you just click on the green button in that pop up
window that says, "merge pull request".
